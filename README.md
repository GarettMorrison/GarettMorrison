### Howdy!
My name is Garett, and I'm a Mechatronics student at Texas A&M University. I mostly use github for versioning and sharing of personal projects. 

I'm interested in robotics, emergent behavior, procedural generation, and mechanical design. I have been fascinated by emergence in simulations for years, and have built a number of evolution simulators from scratch. My most useful project is probably AutoLisp_Tools (in AutoCode), as it resulted in a 75% time save in laser cutting polylines from AutoCad.

I have a number of personal projects documented on my [personal blog](https://garettmorrison.net).

I swear I don't primarily use HTML, my enitre blog publishes from Github and is thus a large fraction of my total volume. I mostly work with C++ and Python, and utilize others as required.
