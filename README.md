### Howdy!
My name is Garett and I like to make things. I mostly use github for versioning and sharing of personal projects. 

Iâ€™m interested in most aspects of robotics, automation, procedural generation and controls. For more info, I have a number of personal projects documented on my [personal blog](https://garettmorrison.net), some of which have reposotories hosted here.
